# Build the Form

All form inputs should have proper labels and follow best practices.

**Pay attention the the instructions if ids and names are not correct, the JavaScript code given to you will not work!**

1.  Create a Form with an id of **calculatorForm**, your don't need an action or a method
2.  Inside of the form create a number input for the _Bill Total_. The name attribute should be **total**
3.  Inside of the form create another number input for the _Number of people_. The name attribute should be **numPeople**
4.  Inside of the form create a select input for the _Service Satisfaction_. The name attribute should be **serviceSatisfaction**. The select should have the following options (Pay attention to how you type them, you will need them later!):

    *   Very satisfied
    *   Service was good (This should be the default selection)
    *   Service was average
    *   Service was OK
    *   Service was terrible
    *   I am too cheap to tip
5.  Create a submit button with the text **Calculate**
6.  Test the form, if everything is correct you should see the text appear (If it doesn't, use the console to look for errors!), the amount won't be correct yet, you will set that soon!
