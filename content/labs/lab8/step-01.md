# Introduction

In this lab you will be building another version of the Todo Application. For this version you will be building the entire application. Utilizing event listeners and the document object model you will be building a simple application to add todos to a list, mark them done, and clear the list of all completed todos. This will also save to localStorage so the todo list stays persistent between window refreshes.
