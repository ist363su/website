What you will need:

- A variable to hold the todo array. The array should hold todo item objects, each object should have 2 properties. ex:
```{ text: "", done: false }```
- an add function that adds a new item to the list
- Event Listener for the Add Form that triggers the add function
- You will need a function that saves the todo list to localStorage
- and also a function to restore the list from localStorage
- a function that takes a click event, and marks a todo item as done.
- Event listeners on each rendered todo item.
- A function that clears the done items from the todo list array.
- An eventListener that listens to the click event on the clear done button and triggers the remove done items function.
