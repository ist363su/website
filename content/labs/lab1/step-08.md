### blog.html

1. Create a new file called blog.html in the same folder as index.html and styles.css
2. Copy all the code from index.html into the new blog.html file so that they're exactly the same
3. In blog.html, delete the paragraph and its text content from `<div class="content">`
4. In that content div, create three (3) new divs. Give each the class of blog-post
5. For each blog-post, create two (2) paragraphs elements with text
6. The two links at the top of the page should now take you between the homepage of the site and the blog page
