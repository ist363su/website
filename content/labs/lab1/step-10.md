### Add a Picture

1. Go to lorempixel.com and copy the src to get a random image that is 200x200 in size
2. In the first blog post, create an image from lorempixel before the first paragraph

### Format the Image

The image is on the page, but it doesn't flow that great with the rest of the text for that post

1. In styles.css, write a rule to float the image left
2. Add some margin on the right and bottom of the image to create some space between the edges of the image and the text
