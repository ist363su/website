# Animations

## Animations.css
In the animations.css stylesheet, add the necessary keyframe at-rules and animations to achieve the following effects

### Box 1
Create an animation for the first box that fades its background color from red to white to blue. The animation should last 3 seconds, play without a delay, and loop an infinite number of times

<video src="/lab3/ani1.mov" width="618" height="408" controls autoplay mute="mute" loop="loop"></video>

### Box 2
Create an animation for the second box that moves it from one side of the page and back again. The animation should last 2 seconds, play without a delay, alternate its play direction, and loop an infinite number of times

<video src="/lab3/ani2.mov" width="618" height="408" controls autoplay mute="mute" loop="loop"></video>

### Box 3
Create an animation for the third box that moves it to the right 100px, then rotates 45 degrees, then grows 150%, then scales back down, then rotates back to 0 degrees, then slides back to it's initial starting position. The animation should last 5 seconds, play without a delay, and loop an infinite number of times

<video src="/lab3/ani3.mov" width="618" height="408" controls autoplay mute="mute" loop="loop"></video>
