# Create the Dachshund component

Now that we have the API Key we can build our first component

![Dachshund Component](/lab10/dachshund-component.png)

Once you build the component you can mount it to the DOM

![Dachshund mounted](/lab10/mount-component.png)

Run your GoLive Server and check your application, you should see a list of videos about Dachshunds!

Once you have the first one working, the other 2 are trivial, complete those also using the playlists instead of videos
