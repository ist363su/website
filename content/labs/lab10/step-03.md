# Create the Search Component

The Search Component is very similar to the other components, except it has a form and does not retrieve the results until the user hits *enter*.

- Very similar to the other components
- Add another property to the state to contain the search query
- Add 2 functions to update the search query and the handle the form submission
- Add a form to the render function so the user can enter a search term.

- You will need to mount the search component to the DOM
