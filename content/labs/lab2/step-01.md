For page1.html, create eight flex containers. Each container will contains flex items that are 200px tall. Each flex item should also have 10px margin on all sides. Refer to the image below for the final mockup of how the completed page should look

1. Flex Container 1 (Blue): There should be two flex items, equal in size, taking up all available space.
2. Flex Container 2 (Red): There should be three flex items in this container. The first and the last should be equal in size, while the middle item is twice their size.
3. Flex Container 3 (Purple): Similar to container 2, except the first and last should be twice the size of the middle item.
4. Flex Container 4 (Green): Each flex item should take up 1/3 of the available space. The first one should be positioned on the left side of the container, and the second on the right.
5. Flex Container 5 (Tan): Each flex item should take up 1/3 of the available space. They should be positioned in the center horizontally
6. Flex Container 6 (Slate Gray): Each flex item should take up 1/4 of the available space. The space between each flex item should be double the space on the inside edges of the flex container.
